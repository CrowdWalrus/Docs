### Overview
Admins in the CrowdWalrus platform are responsible for overseeing and verifying projects and campaigns. Their tasks involve reviewing submitted content, making sure about legitimacy of the project, and ensuring the platform's integrity. When a project or a campaign get verified by admins, they got a "Verified Badge". Below is a breakdown of the key user flows for admins.
