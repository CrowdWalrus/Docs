# CrowdWalrus UX QA 🧪

Inviting external users to participate in UX testing comes with several practical challenges. Testers often require **WAL or Sui testnet tokens** to interact meaningfully with the dApp, which introduces additional operational friction. There is also a natural **trust barrier**: many users are understandably hesitant to connect their wallets to unfamiliar dApps due to security concerns.

Additionally, some potential testers were not yet onboarded into the **Sui ecosystem** and first needed to install a compatible wallet and complete initial setup before they could begin testing.

The QA phase also kicked off **close to the Christmas and year-end holiday period**, which naturally reduced user availability and responsiveness and had a measurable impact on live user testing velocity. Despite this timing constraint, we adopted a dual approach—**public community invitations** combined with **direct and cold outreach** to individuals and teams.

## 📊 QA Outcomes & Scale

This approach proved effective. During the QA period, we recorded:

- 🧩 **Nearly 400 test campaigns created**
- 🔁 **Hundreds of campaign interactions**
- 👥 **Over 2,000 new user test sign-ups**

These results provided strong real-world usage signals across all core user flows and validated the platform under realistic conditions.

A brief report below outlines the execution and outcomes from both **public announcements** and **targeted outreach efforts**.
