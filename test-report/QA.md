# CrowdWalrus UX QA

Inviting external users to participate in UX testing comes with several practical challenges. Testers often require WAL or Sui testnet tokens to interact meaningfully with the dApp, which adds operational friction. There is also a natural trust barrier: many users are hesitant to connect their wallets to unfamiliar dApps due to security concerns.

In addition, some potential testers are not yet onboarded into the Sui ecosystem and must first install a compatible wallet and complete initial setup before they can even begin testing.

The QA phase also kicked off close to the Christmas and year-end holiday period, which naturally reduced user availability and responsiveness and had a direct impact on live user testing velocity. Despite this timing constraint, we adopted a dual approach—publicly inviting testers from the broader community while also conducting direct and cold outreach to individuals and teams.

This approach proved effective. During the QA period, we recorded **nearly 400 test campaigns**, **hundreds of campaign interactions**, and **over 2,000 new user test sign-ups**, providing substantial real-world usage signals across core user flows.

A brief report below outlines the results and observations from both public invitations and targeted cold outreach efforts.
