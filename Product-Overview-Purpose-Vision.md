## Purpose & Problem Statement 🎯

Traditional crowdfunding platforms, while beneficial, have significant limitations that CrowdWalrus aims to solve. Our team, as former builders of the Giveth donation platform, witnessed firsthand the common problems that hinder fundraisers and donors:

* ✂️ **High Fees:** Major platforms often take a **5-10% cut** of each donation in platform and payment processing fees. For a $10,000 campaign, this can mean up to $1,000 lost to intermediaries. On CrowdWalrus, 100% of the donation (minus a minimal network transaction fee) goes directly to the non-profit recipiant.

* 🚫 **Censorship & Gatekeeping:** Centralized sites can unilaterally remove campaigns or reject projects that don't align with their policies or are deemed controversial. This puts creators of political art, investigative journalism, or activism in certain regions at risk of being de-platformed without warning. Because CrowdWalrus sites are hosted on a decentralized network, they cannot be taken down by a single entity.

* 🚧 **Barriers to Entry:** Many platforms have strict requirements based on location, banking access, or lengthy approval processes. This excludes creators in unsupported countries and the millions of unbanked individuals worldwide. CrowdWalrus is globally accessible; all you need is an internet connection and a crypto wallet.

CrowdWalrus directly addresses these issues by leveraging a powerful decentralized stack. The **Sui blockchain** ensures transactions are fast, secure, and low-cost 💸. **Walrus distributed web hosting** guarantees that campaign pages remain online and censorship-resistant ✅. We guide new users through a simple wallet setup process, making the platform inclusive for everyone.

Our purpose is to offer a truly **inclusive, censorship-resistant, and low-cost** crowdfunding solution that empowers both creators and donors. 🚀

## Vision & Goals 🌟

### Our Vision

We envision a world where creators can fund their work without gatekeepers, and communities can rally around causes they believe in without barriers. In this future, raising money for a brilliant idea, a critical open-source tool, or a local public good is as simple as sharing a story—with no central authority having the power to shut it down. Our long-term vision is to foster a global, self-sustaining ecosystem of giving and creativity, where decentralized crowdfunding is the trusted norm. 🌍
