# What is CrowdWalrus

CrowdWalrus is a **decentralized crowdfunding app** built on **Sui + Walrus**, designed for builders, communities, and creators who want fundraising that’s:

- **On-chain** (campaigns, donations, updates, and profiles are blockchain transactions)
- **Censorship-resistant** (rich content and media are stored on Walrus)
- **Transparent by default** (anyone can verify activity on-chain)

**No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just you and your supporters.** 🦭

## What you can do on CrowdWalrus

### For campaign owners
- Create a campaign (name, goal, dates, recipient address, categories, socials)
- Upload a cover + rich story (stored on Walrus)
- Edit campaign basics (some fields are intentionally immutable)
- Post on-chain updates (with Walrus-backed content)
- Deactivate or delete your campaign

### For supporters
- Contribute using supported tokens
- See an on-chain breakdown of where funds went (recipient vs platform fee)
- Earn **NFT badges** as you contribute and participate
- Create a profile to show your identity and contributions

## What CrowdWalrus is **not**

- It’s **not a custodian**: funds don’t sit in a CrowdWalrus bank account.
- It’s **not reversible**: blockchain transactions can’t be “chargebacked.”
- It’s **not a guarantee**: donating is supporting; outcomes depend on campaign owners.

## Why Walrus matters here

Traditional crowdfunding platforms can remove pages, freeze funds, or lose your media.

CrowdWalrus stores your campaign story and media on Walrus, which means:
- your content is addressable by content IDs
- your campaign can stay readable even if frontends change

> **Heads up:** Walrus content is public by default. Don’t upload private keys, passports, or anything you wouldn’t tweet.
