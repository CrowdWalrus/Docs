# CrowdWalrus Financial Models | Split Policies

## Overview
CrowdWalrus is a crowdfunding platform designed to support a variety of projects and campaigns, with a unique financial model based on self-declaration and option selection by project creators. This model emphasizes transparency, flexibility, and incentivization for campaign managers while ensuring funds are distributed efficiently and equitably to their intended purposes. The platform operates across multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) to maximize accessibility and engagement, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for creators, hosts, and donors/investors.

## Financial Model

### Self-Declaration Policy for CrowdWalrus commission/fee
- Non-Profit Status: Projects or campaigns that self-declare as non-profit are eligible for a zero-commission fee. This incentivizes genuine non-profit initiatives by reducing financial barriers.
- Verification Process: If a project’s non-profit claim is found to be inaccurate during verification, it risks being excluded from the benefits of being listed on CrowdWalrus. This ensures trust and integrity within the platform.
- For-Profit Campaigns: Campaigns that do not claim non-profit status are subject to standard commission rates (not specified in the provided context but implied as part of the platform’s operational model).

### Incentive Structure for Campaign Managers
- Campaign Manager Roles: Campaign managers are typically artists, influencers, executives in public goods domains, producers, individuals in the scene, or developers. These individuals bring visibility and credibility to campaigns.
- Host Relationship: Campaign managers can be accepted as hosts by a project. The hosting project may request a percentage of the campaign manager’s earnings to cover operational or general costs, which the campaign can accept or negotiate during setup.
  - Example: A well-known charity might host multiple campaigns under its umbrella, benefiting from the visibility of campaign creators while supporting impactful projects or public goods initiatives. The campaign managers, in turn, gain credibility by associating with a reputable host.
- Mutual Benefits: This structure fosters a symbiotic relationship where campaign creators gain exposure under established hosts, and hosts benefit from the campaigns’ success.

### Fund Distribution
- Predefined Sharing Model: When a campaign or project is created, a sharing model is established and communicated transparently to all parties (campaign managers, hosts, and donors/investors).
- Immediate Distribution: Once funds are received from investors or donors, they are distributed immediately according to the predefined sharing model.
- Intended Purposes: Funds are allocated to their intended purposes (e.g., project execution, public goods, or specific community initiatives) as outlined during campaign creation.

### Example Scenario
A non-profit organization, such as a charity focused on education, hosts multiple campaigns under its banner. These campaigns, created by artists or community leaders, aim to fund specific initiatives like building schools or providing scholarships. The charity requests a small percentage of the campaign managers’ earnings to cover administrative costs, which the campaign managers agree to during setup. When donations are received, the funds are split according to the agreed-upon model: a portion goes to the campaign’s goals (e.g., school construction), a portion to the campaign manager for their efforts, and a portion to the hosting charity for operational support. This ensures transparency and alignment of interests across all parties.
