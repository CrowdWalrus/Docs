# Differences Between Projects and Campaigns in CrowdWalrus

CrowdWalrus is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that distinguishes between two main entities: **projects** and **campaigns**. Projects are long-term, overarching structures that host and organize multiple campaigns, while campaigns are time-bound fundraising efforts with specific goals. This separation provides flexibility, scalability, and trust for diverse users across the platform.

## Projects

- **No Time Limit**:  
  Projects are ongoing and perpetual. They don’t have a defined start or end date, allowing them to serve as a stable foundation for community and fundraising activities.

- **No Financial Goal**:  
  Projects do not define a fixed monetary target. Instead, their focus is on long-term support, visibility, and community building.

- **Hosting Role**:  
  Projects act as containers for campaigns. Multiple campaigns can be affiliated with a single project, which serves as a centralized hub for related initiatives.

- **Moderators**:  
  Projects are managed by moderators or teams who oversee operations, maintain guidelines, and approve campaign affiliations.

- **Examples**:  
  - Online or offline communities (fan groups, local societies)  
  - Non-profits or charities with long-term missions (education, environment, healthcare)  
  - NGOs addressing global or regional issues  
  - Ecosystems supporting public goods (open-source collectives, community libraries, public parks initiatives)

> **In essence**, projects provide a “home base” where campaigns can plug in and leverage shared credibility, audience, and infrastructure.

## Campaigns

- **Defined Time Window**:  
  Campaigns have a start and end date, creating urgency for contributions and fostering momentum.

- **Financial Goal**:  
  Each campaign sets a specific monetary target, making success measurable against this benchmark.

- **Funding Policies**:  
  - **All or Nothing (AON):** Funds are refunded to donors if the goal isn’t reached by the deadline.  
  - **Take It All (TIA):** Campaigns keep all raised funds regardless of meeting the target.

- **Single Manager**:  
  A campaign is managed by one creator, responsible for daily operations, updates, and donor communication.

- **Affiliation with Projects**:  
  Campaigns can apply to join existing projects. If approved, they gain added visibility, endorsement, and community trust.

- **Examples**:  
  - Artists funding a specific album, film, or art installation  
  - Celebrities launching short-term charity drives  
  - Entrepreneurs and activists executing targeted projects  
  - Open-source developers raising funds for features or bug fixes  
  - Local community efforts (e.g., disaster relief, school construction)

## Key Benefits and Interactions

This dual-structure approach strengthens the platform:

- **Projects** build ecosystems, ensuring continuity, credibility, and moderator oversight.  
- **Campaigns** drive action with time-bound goals and funding urgency.  
- **Affiliations** between campaigns and projects amplify reach, foster collaboration, and build trust.

This model allows **large organizations**, **small teams**, and **individual creators** to coexist within a transparent, decentralized ecosystem while prioritizing **public goods** and **community-driven impact**.
