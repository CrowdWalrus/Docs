# NFT Reward Mechanism in CrowdWalrus

## Overview

The NFT reward mechanism on CrowdWalrus aims to incentivize backers and donors by providing them with unique NFTs upon their participation in campaigns and projects. The system is designed with multiple user leveling tiers that are based on the amount and frequency of donations or contributions made by the users. This structure ensures that the more a user contributes, the more valuable and exclusive their rewards become. These NFTs serve as a form of recognition, allowing users to showcase their contributions within the community.

## How It Works

The NFT reward mechanism works as follows:

1. **User Levels**: Users are categorized into different levels based on their donation history. The more a user donates, the higher their level and the better their NFT reward.
    - **Level 1**: At the entry-level, a user can earn the Level 1 NFT with just a single donation.
    - **Higher Levels**: As users make more donations, they advance through higher levels, unlocking more exclusive and valuable NFTs.

2. **Automatic NFT Minting**: Once a user reaches a certain level based on their donation activities, the system automatically mints the corresponding NFT for them. This process happens seamlessly in the background after each donation.

3. **Public Display**: The earned NFTs are publicly displayed on the userâ€™s profile. This feature helps to recognize and appreciate the backers' and donors' efforts in supporting various campaigns.

4. **Exclusive Tiers**: Higher-tier NFTs are more difficult to attain, ensuring that only users with significant contributions are rewarded with exclusive badges, promoting a sense of prestige and accomplishment.

5. **Notification and Minting**: After each donation or participation, the platform detects the user's new level, mints the NFT accordingly, and notifies the user.

## Benefits for Backers and Donors

- **Recognition**: Users are rewarded with exclusive NFTs as a way to recognize their contributions, fostering a sense of community and achievement.
- **Increased Engagement**: The leveling system encourages users to make more donations to reach higher levels and unlock better rewards.
- **Transparency**: The rewards are displayed publicly on user profiles, providing transparency regarding contributions and reinforcing the importance of community support.

By leveraging NFTs in this way, CrowdWalrus creates a more engaging, gamified experience for users while promoting the sustainability and success of crowdfunding efforts.

## Conclusion

The NFT reward system on CrowdWalrus incentivizes backers and donors to participate more actively in projects and campaigns. This system not only rewards users but also encourages greater contributions, which ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem. It enhances the platform's community-driven nature while providing users with exclusive digital assets as a token of their support.
