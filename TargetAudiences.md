## Target Audience

CrowdWalrus is built for a diverse audience of users who are passionate about creating and supporting projects. We’ve designed the platform with accessibility and inclusion in mind, focusing on the needs of the following groups:

### Project Creators & Fundraisers

Whether you’re an artist with a dream, a startup founder, a community organizer, or a nonprofit leader, CrowdWalrus is for you. Creators want an easy way to share their story and raise funds without jumping through hoops. On CrowdWalrus, you can launch a campaign site in minutes, with no approval gatekeepers or complicated setup. It’s ideal for grassroots fundraisers and public good project owners who have been priced out or restricted by traditional platforms. We ensure you keep full ownership of your campaign content and funds – there’s no company taking a cut or telling you what you can or cannot fundraise for. This empowers project managers to focus on their mission, not the platform’s rules.

### Donors & Supporters

CrowdWalrus welcomes anyone who wants to support causes and creators directly. Our donors range from crypto philanthropists to casual givers who might be new to blockchain. What they have in common is a desire to see their contributions make an impact. Donors on CrowdWalrus get a transparent view of where their money goes – every donation is tracked and visible, giving peace of mind that 100% of their gift reaches the intended project. There are no platform fees or middlemen diverting funds, and donors can even remain pseudonymous if they prefer (using just their wallet). Over time, supporters can earn rewards and recognition for their generosity, making giving a more engaging, community-driven experience. If you believe in a project, CrowdWalrus makes it simple to contribute and follow the project’s journey with updates and clear accountability.

### Public Goods Communities

We place a special focus on those building or funding public goods – things like open-source software, educational programs, environmental initiatives, and other projects that benefit everyone. These communities often struggle with funding on traditional platforms, which might favor commercial projects. CrowdWalrus is designed to serve public goods projects by providing a zero-fee, censorship-resistant home for their fundraising. If you’re part of an open-source community, a decentralized collective, or any group effort for social good, you’ll find CrowdWalrus aligns with your values. The platform’s future features (like quadratic funding rounds) are especially beneficial for public goods, as they can unlock matching funds and rally broad support. We are committed to helping altruistic and community-driven projects thrive by connecting them with donors globally and giving them tools usually reserved for big organizations.

### Easy to Use for Everyone

No matter who you are – creator or supporter – CrowdWalrus is built to be welcoming and easy to use. We understand that many in our target audience might be unfamiliar with blockchain, so the platform experience is kept intuitive. From wallet setup to donating, the user flows feel as easy as a Web2 website. You don’t need to be a tech expert to start a campaign or make a contribution. By prioritizing simplicity and guidance (for example, offering prompts to set up a wallet or acquire a custom domain), we ensure everyone can participate in decentralized crowdfunding.

Our commitment to accessibility means language, location, or technical background shouldn’t be a barrier – CrowdWalrus is for the worldwide community. We invite project creators, donors, and all changemakers to join us in this new era of open, community-powered crowdfunding. Together, we’re creating a platform where everyone has a seat at the table and a chance to make a difference.
