# CrowdWalrus Docs (Draft Content Pack)

This folder contains **markdown-first documentation pages** for the CrowdWalrus docs website.

- Tone: builder-friendly, “no gatekeepers” vibes.
- Assumption: campaigns, updates, profiles, and payments are **on-chain on Sui**, while rich content (images + editor state) is stored on **Walrus**.
