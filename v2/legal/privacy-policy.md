## What we collect
CrowdWalrus is designed to minimize data collection.

However, blockchain apps are inherently public:
- wallet addresses
- transactions
- on-chain metadata

## What you control
If you create a profile, you choose what metadata to publish (name, bio, socials, email).

## Walrus storage
Media uploaded to Walrus is publicly retrievable by blob id.
Do not upload sensitive personal data.

## Analytics
TODO: describe any analytics used (if any).

## Contact
TODO: add a support contact.
