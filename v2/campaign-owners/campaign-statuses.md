# Campaign Statuses

CrowdWalrus uses a simple status model based on dates + flags.

## Open Soon
- The campaign start date is in the future.
- Supporters can read, but donations aren’t open yet.

## Funding
- Current time is between start and end.
- Donations are enabled.

## Active
- End date has passed.
- Campaign is “complete,” but the page stays up for updates, transparency, and history.

## Ended
- Campaign is deactivated or deleted.
- Donations are disabled.

## Verified vs Unverified (visibility)
Separate from the above status, campaigns can be:
- **Unverified**: fully functional, but usually not listed in discovery.
- **Verified**: reviewed and eligible for listing.
