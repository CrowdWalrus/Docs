# Choosing a recipient wallet

The **recipient wallet** is where the campaign funds go.

## Pick an address you control
- Ideally a dedicated wallet (not your personal hot wallet)
- For teams: consider a multi-sig or DAO treasury address

## Important: recipient address is immutable
CrowdWalrus intentionally makes the recipient address **unchangeable** to prevent bait-and-switch.

✅ Good: “This is the organization’s treasury address.”
❌ Bad: “We’ll change the address later.”

## What supporters will see
Donations show:
- the recipient address
- the platform fee address (if any)
- the split amounts
