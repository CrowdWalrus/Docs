# Verification & Listing

CrowdWalrus is open by default:

✅ Anyone can create a campaign.

Verification is about one thing: **trust at scale**.

## What the verified badge means
A verified badge signals:
- the campaign passed basic review checks
- it doesn’t violate content rules
- the identity/story has sufficient proof

## Benefits of verification
- Eligible for **homepage / explore listing**
- Higher trust for new supporters

## What verification does **not** do
- It does not guarantee success.
- It does not mean the platform endorses outcomes.

## How to apply
See: [Apply for Verification](../trust-safety/apply-for-verification.md)
