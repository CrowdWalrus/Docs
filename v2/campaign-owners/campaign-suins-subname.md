# Campaign SuiNS Subname

Each campaign has a **subname label** (your “slug”).

CrowdWalrus can register leaf subnames under its domains:
- Mainnet: `crowdwalrus.sui`
- Testnet: `crowdwalrus-test.sui`

So a campaign might be:
- `my-campaign.crowdwalrus.sui`

## Why this matters
- Human-readable identity
- Easier sharing
- A consistent brand handle for your campaign

## If your subname is taken
Pick a different label:
- add a suffix (`my-campaign-v2`)
- use hyphens
- keep it short and memorable
