# Campaign Deactivation

Deactivation stops fundraising while keeping the page up.

## When to deactivate
- You reached your goal early
- You want to pause donations
- You discovered an issue and need to regroup

## What happens after deactivation
- Donations are disabled
- Campaign status shows as ended
- Updates remain readable

## Can I reactivate?
Depending on the version of the app, reactivation may be supported.
If it is, it’s also an on-chain transaction.
