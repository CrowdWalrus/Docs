# Launch a Campaign (Step-by-step)

This is the “from zero to fundraising” path.

## Before you start
- A Sui wallet installed
- Enough **SUI** for gas
- Enough **WAL** for storage (cover image + story)

## Step 1 — Open the campaign creator
In the app, click **Create Campaign**.

## Step 2 — Fill in the basics
You’ll provide:
- **Campaign name**
- **Short description** (the one-line pitch)
- **Subname** (your URL / SuiNS label)

Subname rules:
- lowercase letters + numbers
- interior hyphens allowed
- no leading/trailing hyphens

## Step 3 — Choose a campaign policy
Pick a **campaign type / policy preset**.

This controls how payouts work (for example: nonprofit policy may have 0 platform fee).

## Step 4 — Categories & socials
Select at least one category and optionally add up to 5 social links.

## Step 5 — Goal and timeline
- Set a **goal in USD** (for readability)
- Pick a **start** and **end** date

> The goal is a UI/analytics target. Donations are still made in tokens.

## Step 6 — Recipient wallet
Enter the Sui address that should receive campaign funds.

⚠️ **This is immutable.** Double-check the address.

## Step 7 — Upload your cover + story
- Cover image (JPG/PNG, up to ~5MB)
- Full story (rich editor)

This content is stored on Walrus.

## Step 8 — Choose storage duration
Select how long to store your campaign content on Walrus (epochs).

Don’t overthink it:
- Testnet: pick a short option
- Mainnet: pick 6 months–1 year, then renew later

## Step 9 — Sign transactions
Campaign creation usually involves multiple steps:
1. Walrus registration transaction
2. Walrus certification transaction
3. Final “Create Campaign” transaction on Sui

You’ll see a wallet confirmation for each.
