# Campaign Deletion

Deletion is the “hard stop.”

## What deletion means in a blockchain app
On-chain history still exists, but the campaign is marked as deleted.

In practice:
- it disappears from discovery
- editing and donating are disabled

## When to delete
- You created a campaign by mistake
- You want it permanently removed from the app’s public surfaces

⚠️ Deletion is usually irreversible.
