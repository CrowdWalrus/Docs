# Storage epochs: what you’re paying for & why

When you publish a campaign, you’re storing your media and story on **Walrus**.

Walrus storage is bought for a number of **epochs**.

## Epoch duration
According to Walrus network parameters:
- Testnet epoch duration: **1 day**
- Mainnet epoch duration: **2 weeks**

Source:
- https://docs.wal.app/docs/usage/networks

## Why CrowdWalrus asks you to choose epochs
Because storage is prepaid. The number of epochs determines:
- how long your campaign content remains available
- how much WAL you pay up-front

## Renewals
Walrus supports extending storage by paying for additional time (renewal). For protocol background:
- https://docs.wal.app/docs/usage/started

**CrowdWalrus note:** depending on the version of the app, renewal might not have a one-click UI yet. If/when you edit Walrus-backed content, the app may upload a new blob/quilt.

## Cost estimation
Walrus maintains a cost calculator:
