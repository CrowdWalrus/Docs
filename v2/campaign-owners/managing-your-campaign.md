# Managing Your Campaign

Once your campaign is live, you can keep it healthy and credible by:

## Editing campaign info
CrowdWalrus supports editing **some** fields.

Typically editable:
- campaign name
- short description
- categories
- socials
- story + cover (Walrus-backed)
- storage duration (by re-uploading Walrus content)

Typically **not** editable (by design):
- funding goal
- recipient address
- subname
- start/end dates

Why? To prevent bait-and-switch and keep donations honest.

## Posting updates & milestones
Updates are how you earn trust.

What to include:
- what you shipped
- what you learned
- what’s next
- receipts (links, images, commits)

## Receipts best practices
- link to a repo PR
- include invoice screenshots (redact private info)
- share testnet/mainnet tx digests for spend
