# Choosing a goal & timeline

## Goal (USD)
CrowdWalrus asks for a **USD goal** so campaigns are comparable.

- It’s a target for dashboards and progress bars.
- Supporters can still donate in supported tokens.
- USD tracking uses an oracle price at the time of donation.

**Suggestion:** choose a goal that matches a real milestone (a prototype, a month of runway, a specific deliverable).

## Timeline
Campaigns use a start/end window.

- Before start → **Open Soon**
- During window → **Funding**
- After end → **Active** (campaign is done, page remains)

### Best practice
- 2–6 weeks is a sweet spot for most campaigns.
- Short windows create urgency; longer windows require more updates.
