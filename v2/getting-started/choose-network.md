# Choose network (Testnet vs Mainnet)

CrowdWalrus can run on multiple Sui networks:

## Testnet
- Free test coins (no real value)
- Best for trying features, QA, and demos
- Walrus epochs are shorter (so storage testing is easier)

## Mainnet
- Real funds
- Real consequences
- Best when you’re ready for production fundraising

## How to switch networks
Most wallets let you switch networks inside settings.

> If your wallet is on Mainnet but the app is set to Testnet (or vice versa), you’ll get errors like “network mismatch” or transactions failing to build.
