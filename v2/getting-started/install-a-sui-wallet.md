# Install a Sui wallet

To use CrowdWalrus, you need a wallet that can:
- connect to Sui dApps
- sign transactions
- hold SUI (gas) and other Sui tokens

## Recommended: Slush (formerly Sui Wallet)
Slush is the Mysten Labs wallet app for the Sui ecosystem.

- Browser extension
- Mobile apps
- Supports dApp connections and network switching

## Alternatives
If you already have a Sui-compatible wallet, that’s fine too.

Common options in the Sui ecosystem include Suiet, Ethos, and Martian.

## Safety checklist
- Only install wallets from official sources.
- Never share your seed phrase.
- Use a hardware wallet for serious funds.
