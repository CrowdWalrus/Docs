# Get WAL for storage (Walrus)

CrowdWalrus uses **Walrus** to store:
- campaign cover images
- rich story content
- updates
- profile avatars

That means campaign owners (and sometimes profile creators) need **WAL** to pay for storage.

## On Testnet
Walrus provides a built-in way to get testnet WAL.
From Walrus docs (networks page):
- https://docs.wal.app/docs/usage/networks

If you’re using the Walrus CLI, there is a command that can exchange test SUI for test WAL.

## On Mainnet
You’ll need real WAL (acquired through the ecosystem).

## What you’re paying for
Walrus storage is bought for **epochs**.
- Testnet epoch: **1 day**
- Mainnet epoch: **2 weeks**
