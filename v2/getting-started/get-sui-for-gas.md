# Get SUI for gas

Every on-chain action (creating a campaign, donating, posting updates) requires **SUI gas**.

## On Testnet
Use the official Sui faucet:
- https://faucet.sui.io/

Sui docs: “Get coins from faucet”
- https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins

## On Mainnet
There is no faucet. You’ll need to acquire SUI from a supported exchange or on-chain swap.

## Pro tip
Keep a small buffer of SUI in your wallet.
If you run out of gas, you can’t sign anything — even if you have other tokens.
