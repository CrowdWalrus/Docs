# FAQ

## Is CrowdWalrus custodial?
No. Funds move via on-chain transactions.

## Can I create an unverified campaign?
Yes. **Everyone can create campaigns.**

Verification affects *visibility/listing*, not whether the campaign can exist or raise funds.

## Is a donation refundable?
No. On-chain transactions are generally irreversible.

## Why do I need WAL?
WAL pays for Walrus storage (media + rich content).

## Why do you show USD values if I donate tokens?
USD value is for **stats and comparability** across tokens. You still donate in the token you select.

## Can I edit my funding goal?
No (by design). This prevents bait-and-switch behavior.

## Can I change my campaign recipient wallet?
No (by design). Pick carefully.

## Where do NFT rewards come from?
CrowdWalrus mints NFT badges automatically when you hit participation thresholds.
