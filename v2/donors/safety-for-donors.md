# Safety for Donors

Crowdfunding is powerful — and it can be abused.
Here’s how to stay safe.

## Verify legitimacy
- Look for a **verified badge** (but still do your own research)
- Check the campaign’s links (repo, website, socials)
- Review updates and receipts

## Warning signs
- No real identity or proof
- Vague budget (“marketing” with no details)
- Pressure tactics (“donate now or else”)
- Recipient address doesn’t match the claimed entity

## Reporting
If you suspect abuse, report it:
- via the app’s reporting channel (if present)
- or via GitHub/issues or the official support email
