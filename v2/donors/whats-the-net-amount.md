# What’s the Net Amount?

When you donate, there are three numbers that matter:

1. **Donation amount** — the tokens you send
2. **Gas** — SUI spent to execute the transaction
3. **Net amount** — what the campaign recipient receives

## Platform fee (basis points)
Some campaigns have a platform fee.

- Fees are expressed in **bps** (basis points)
- 100 bps = 1%

Example:
- You donate 10 SUI
- Platform fee is 100 bps (1%)
- Recipient receives 9.9 SUI
- Platform receives 0.1 SUI

## Important
- Gas is separate from platform fees.
- The split happens on-chain (auditable).
