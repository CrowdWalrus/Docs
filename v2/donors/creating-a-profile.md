# Creating a Profile

Profiles make addresses human.

## What you can add
- avatar (optional)
- name (optional)
- bio (optional)
- email (optional — public if you add it)
- socials (optional)
- profile subname (optional)

## Storage cost
If you upload an avatar, it’s stored on Walrus.
That means you need a bit of WAL to pay for storage.

## Privacy note
Profiles are public.
Don’t add personal info you don’t want indexed forever.
