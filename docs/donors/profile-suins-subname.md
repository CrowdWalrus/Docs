# Profile SuiNS Subname

Your profile can have an optional subname under the CrowdWalrus domain.

Examples:
- `yourname.crowdwalrus.sui`
- `yourname.crowdwalrus-test.sui`

## Why use a subname
- makes your profile shareable
- acts like your handle across the app

## If the subname is taken
Try variants:
- add a suffix
- use hyphens
