# How to Contribute (Step-by-step)

Supporting a campaign is an on-chain transaction.

## Step 1 — Connect your wallet
Make sure you’re on the right network (Testnet vs Mainnet).

## Step 2 — Open a campaign page
You can find campaigns via:
- home / explore (usually verified)
- direct links (any campaign)

## Step 3 — Click “Contribute”
Pick:
- token
- amount

You’ll see:
- estimated USD value
- platform fee (if any)
- recipient net amount
