---

## 2. Regulatory Status and No Voluntary Financial-Intermediary Role

**2.1** General Magic AG is a Swiss company based in Zug. The Platform is a technical infrastructure that enables campaigns and token-based contributions on the Sui Network.

**2.2** The Platform is designed as a **non-custodial, peer-to-peer** interface. We do not intend to act as your bank, broker, asset manager, deposit-taker, payment institution, financial intermediary, trustee or escrow agent.

**2.3** Nothing in these Terms shall be interpreted as:

* (a) General Magic accepting any contractual role as your financial intermediary, representative, trustee, or agent for the handling of funds; or
* (b) General Magic providing any form of investment, legal, tax or other regulated advice.

**2.4** The legal qualification of General Magic’s activities (including any qualification as a “financial intermediary” under the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act or similar laws) is determined **solely by applicable law and regulators**, not by these Terms. To the extent such laws impose obligations directly on General Magic, those obligations apply independently of these Terms.

**2.5** Depending on how a campaign is structured (for example if it offers profit participation or tokenized securities), the campaign and/or its Raiser may be subject to financial market regulation in Switzerland or abroad. Each Raiser is solely responsible for complying with all such laws and regulatory requirements.

**2.6** Nothing on the Platform constitutes:

* (a) investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any crypto-asset or financial instrument; or
* (b) a representation that your use of the Platform is lawful in your jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for verifying this.

---

## 3. User Eligibility and General Legal Compliance

**3.1** You may use the Platform only if:

* (a) you are at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity;
* (b) your use of the Platform is not prohibited by any laws or regulations applicable to you, including those relating to:

  * anti-money laundering (“AML”),
  * counter-terrorist financing,
  * sanctions and export controls,
  * securities, tax and consumer protection;
* (c) you are not subject to any embargo, sanction, or similar measure imposed by Switzerland, the United States, the European Union or any other competent authority.

**3.2** **User responsibility for all applicable laws**

You are **solely and fully responsible** for ensuring that your access to and use of the Platform (including creating or funding campaigns, sending or receiving Supported Tokens, and claiming rewards):

* (a) complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you in all relevant jurisdictions;
* (b) does not violate any prohibition relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, tax evasion, market abuse, corruption, cybercrime, or other criminal offences;
* (c) is permitted with respect to both your status as payer (Backer) and your status as recipient (Raiser, where applicable).

**3.3** We do not guarantee that the Platform is lawful or available in any particular jurisdiction. We may restrict, block or terminate access from certain countries or to certain users at our discretion or if required by law.

---

## 4. AML / KYC, Sanctions and User Self-Responsibility

**4.1** **Your own AML/KYC obligations**

You understand and agree that:

* (a) you are solely responsible for complying with any AML, KYC, sanctions, “travel rule”, reporting and other compliance obligations that may apply to you personally (for example because you qualify as a financial intermediary, VASP, obliged entity or similar under the laws of any jurisdiction);
* (b) you must conduct your own due diligence on your counterparties (e.g. campaign owners, donors, beneficiaries) and on the origin and destination of funds;
* (c) any decision to send or receive funds via the Platform is taken independently by you, at your sole risk and responsibility.

**4.2** **No reliance on the Platform for AML/KYC**

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* (a) General Magic does **not** undertake to perform AML/KYC checks on users or campaigns on your behalf;
* (b) you must **not** rely on the existence, absence, or perceived quality of any checks we may perform (or not perform) as evidence that a user, campaign, transaction or token is lawful, low-risk, trustworthy or compliant;
* (c) unless we explicitly state otherwise in writing, we make **no assurances** that any campaign owner, donor, contributor or other user has been identified, verified, screened or monitored under AML/KYC or sanctions rules.

**4.3** **Platform’s own mandatory AML obligations**

To the limited extent that Swiss or other mandatory laws directly impose AML/KYC, sanctions or similar obligations on General Magic (for example if and when we are legally classified as a financial intermediary), we may:

* (a) request and verify information and documentation from you;
* (b) screen your data and transactions against sanctions and risk indicators;
* (c) refuse, delay, block or reverse access to portions of the Platform or to specific transactions;
* (d) submit reports or information to competent authorities.

Such actions are carried out solely to comply with our own legal obligations and risk management and do **not** create any contractual duty to you to monitor, detect, prevent, or remediate unlawful activity by any user.

**4.4** Your failure to provide complete and accurate information when requested may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Platform.

---

## 5. Description of the Platform and P2P Nature of Transfers

**5.1** The Platform provides technical tools and Smart Contracts on Sui for:

* (a) Raisers to create and manage campaigns, including configuring campaign parameters and recipient wallets;
* (b) Backers to contribute Supported Tokens directly from their own Sui wallets to campaigns;
* (c) optional reward mechanisms (e.g. NFTs or other on-chain signals) attached to contributions.

**5.2** **Peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers**

To the extent the Platform is implemented as designed:

* (a) contributions are executed via Smart Contracts that transfer Supported Tokens **directly from the Backer’s wallet to the campaign’s designated on-chain address or Smart Contract-controlled address**;
* (b) General Magic does not, in the ordinary course, take custody of Supported Tokens on its own balance sheet or in omnibus accounts;
* (c) we act as a **technical facilitator** and user interface provider, not as your broker, trustee, fiduciary, escrow agent, payment institution or financial intermediary.

**5.3** You acknowledge and agree that:

* (a) each contribution represents a direct P2P transfer between you and the Raiser (or its designated on-chain address);
* (b) any obligations relating to use of funds, delivery of rewards, project execution, or compliance with law are obligations of the Raiser, not General Magic;
* (c) we are not party to the legal relationship between Backers and Raisers.

---

## 6. Use of the Sui Blockchain and Smart Contracts

**6.1** The Platform relies on the **Sui Network** and on **Smart Contracts** deployed on Sui. Your use of the Platform necessarily involves interacting with decentralized infrastructure that is not owned or controlled by General Magic.

**6.2** **Irreversibility and finality.** Blockchain transactions are generally **irreversible** once confirmed. You acknowledge that contributions, transfers, and other transactions you initiate may not be cancellable, chargebackable, or recoverable.

**6.3** **No control over the network.** General Magic does not control the Sui Network, its validators, consensus, governance, or software. We are not responsible for:

* network outages, congestion, delays, forks, reorganizations, or degraded performance;
* transaction ordering, inclusion, censorship, or validator behaviour;
* changes to protocol rules, fees, or security properties.

**6.4** **Smart-contract risk.** Smart Contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, design limitations, or economic exploits. You acknowledge that:

* Smart Contracts may behave unexpectedly;
* third parties may exploit vulnerabilities;
* losses may occur (including total loss) due to Smart Contract failures or attacks.

**6.5** **Wallet and signing.** All transactions are submitted and signed through your wallet. You are solely responsible for reviewing what you sign, including recipient addresses, token types, amounts, and any on-chain permissions.

**6.6** **No guarantee of uptime or access.** We may update, pause, deprecate, or modify Platform features and interfaces. Network conditions or third-party services may prevent access to parts of the Platform, including campaign pages or displayed data.

---

## 7. Supported Tokens and Crypto-Only Payments

**7.1** **Crypto-only.** The Platform supports contributions using **Supported Tokens** on the Sui Network. The Platform does not process fiat payments, card payments, or bank transfers.

**7.2** **Supported Tokens List.** Only tokens listed on the Supported Tokens List at **[URL]** are supported. We may add, remove, or restrict tokens at any time, including for technical, compliance, security, or risk reasons.

**7.3** **No exchange or conversion service.** General Magic does not operate as an exchange, broker, or conversion provider. If the Platform displays any fiat-equivalent values (e.g. USD), such displays are for convenience only (see Section 11).

**7.4** **Volatility and stablecoin risk.** Crypto-assets may be highly volatile. Even tokens commonly referred to as “stablecoins” may:

* depeg, freeze, become illiquid, or fail;
* be subject to issuer or protocol actions;
* experience market, regulatory, or technical events that affect value or transferability.

**7.5** **Token-specific restrictions.** Some Supported Tokens may be subject to token-level restrictions (e.g. blacklists, freezes, pausing, administrative controls, wrapped-token risks, bridge risks). You accept these risks and are responsible for assessing token properties and constraints.

**7.6** **Third-party dependencies.** Your ability to use a token may depend on wallet support, RPC providers, indexers, or other third-party infrastructure. General Magic is not responsible for third-party outages or failures.

---

## 8. Wallets, Custody and Private Keys

**8.1** **Non-custodial by design.** The Platform is designed to be non-custodial. General Magic does not hold, store, or control your private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials.

**8.2** **You are responsible for your keys.** You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys and wallet access. If you lose access to your wallet, you may permanently lose access to your assets, contributions, rewards, or campaign administration capabilities.

**8.3** **Wallet providers are independent.** Wallets are provided by third parties. General Magic does not warrant the security, availability, or correctness of any wallet software or provider. Your use of a wallet is governed by that provider’s terms and policies.

**8.4** **Transaction review.** You must carefully review each transaction request displayed by your wallet, including addresses, token types, amounts, and any permissions granted. You acknowledge that malicious dApps, browser extensions, malware, or phishing may attempt to deceive you.

**8.5** **No recovery services.** General Magic cannot retrieve private keys, reverse transactions, or restore wallet access. Any “recovery” is solely the responsibility of your wallet provider (if available).

---

## 9. Campaign Creation and Obligations of Raisers

**9.1** Campaign creation tools are provided for Raisers to publish campaign information and configure on-chain parameters (including recipient wallets and, where applicable, reward logic). Raisers are solely responsible for the content and structure of their campaigns.

**9.2** A Raiser:

* (a) represents and warrants that all information provided in the campaign is accurate, not misleading, and kept reasonably up to date, including statements about purpose, use of funds, milestones, and rewards;

* (b) **assumes full and exclusive responsibility** for the campaign, including:

  * use of funds;
  * legal, regulatory and sanctions compliance in all jurisdictions;
  * tax reporting;
  * delivery (or non-delivery) of rewards or other outcomes;

* (c) is solely responsible for ensuring that their campaign does not infringe third-party rights (including IP, privacy, publicity, or consumer protection rights), and that they hold all necessary permissions for campaign materials;

* (d) must not structure or market a campaign in a way that constitutes an unauthorized offering of securities, investment products, collective investment schemes, or other regulated instruments in any jurisdiction.

**9.3** **No verification by default.** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, General Magic does not verify campaign claims, identity, licensing status, or legal compliance of Raisers. Any verification or badge features (if present) do not eliminate the need for independent assessment by Backers.

**9.4** **Updates and communications.** Where the Platform offers update or messaging features, Raisers are responsible for the accuracy and legality of their communications and for handling community expectations appropriately.

---

## 10. Contributions, P2P Relationship and Illegal Activities / Fraud Risk

**10.1** When a Backer contributes Supported Tokens to a campaign:

* (a) the transaction is executed via Sui Smart Contracts and is generally irreversible once confirmed;
* (b) the transfer is, from a legal and economic perspective, a **direct P2P transfer** between the Backer and the Raiser (or its designated address);
* (c) any rights, rewards or acknowledgements arising from the contribution are defined by the campaign terms set by the Raiser and the corresponding on-chain logic.

**10.2** **No responsibility for other users’ acts**

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* (a) General Magic is **not responsible** and assumes **no liability** for any acts or omissions of any Raiser, Backer or other user, including (without limitation) any:

  * illegal activity,
  * fraud, scam, or misrepresentation,
  * breach of contract,
  * misuse of funds,
  * failure to deliver rewards or outcomes;
* (b) General Magic does not guarantee that funds will be used as described by the Raiser, that any project will succeed, or that any off-chain rewards will be delivered.

**10.3** **Do your own research (“DYOR”)**

You acknowledge that:

* (a) you must independently research and assess each campaign, user, token and transaction before contributing or accepting funds;
* (b) you should not rely solely on information appearing on the Platform or on any perceived association with General Magic;
* (c) you bear the entire risk of your contribution, including the risk of total loss and the risk of participating in an unlawful or non-compliant scheme if you fail to perform adequate checks.

**10.4** Nothing in this Section excludes or limits any liability which cannot be excluded or limited under mandatory Swiss law (see Section 19).

---

## 11. Fees, Gas Costs and Price Displays (Pyth)

**11.1** **Network fees (gas).** Transactions on the Sui Network typically require payment of network fees (“gas”). Gas fees are paid to the network/validators and are not controlled by General Magic. Gas fees may fluctuate based on network conditions.

**11.2** **Platform fees (if any).** The Platform may charge fees for certain features now or in the future. Any applicable fee (including its basis and amount) will be displayed or otherwise communicated before you confirm an action where reasonably possible.

**11.3** **Price displays are indicative.** The Platform may display token prices and fiat-equivalent estimates (e.g. USD) using Pyth Price Feeds or other data sources. You acknowledge and agree that:

* such prices are **indicative only** and may be delayed, stale, or incorrect;
* displayed fiat-equivalent values may differ from market prices, execution prices, or amounts you could realize through any exchange;
* displayed values are for informational purposes and **do not** constitute a quote, offer, valuation, or guarantee.

**11.4** **Donation “value” at time of payment.** If the Platform shows an estimated fiat value for a contribution, that estimate is based on the data available **at or around the time the transaction is displayed or submitted** (subject to latency and feed timing). For accounting, tax, or reporting purposes, you should rely on:

* the on-chain token amounts and timestamps, and
* your own independent exchange-rate sources and records.

**11.5** **No liability for pricing errors.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, General Magic is not liable for losses or decisions based on displayed prices or metrics, including errors in Pyth Price Feeds or other data sources.

---

## 12. Cancellations, Refunds and Failed Transactions

**12.1** **No general right of cancellation.** Due to the nature of blockchain transactions, contributions and transfers are generally final once confirmed on-chain.

**12.2** **Refunds only if possible and permitted.** Refunds may occur only if:

* the relevant Smart Contract logic supports refunds; or
* the Raiser voluntarily sends a refund in a separate on-chain transaction; or
* a technical reversal is possible under applicable law and practically feasible (which may not be the case).

General Magic does not guarantee that refunds will be possible.

**12.3** **Failed or pending transactions.** Transactions may fail, be delayed, or remain pending due to network conditions, wallet issues, insufficient gas, invalid parameters, or Smart Contract errors. General Magic is not responsible for failed transactions, but we may display status information where available.

**12.4** **Chargebacks not available.** Crypto transactions generally do not support chargebacks. You acknowledge that you may have no recourse once a contribution is confirmed on-chain.

---

## 13. Risks Specific to Crypto Assets and Sui

**13.1** You acknowledge that using crypto-assets and blockchain networks involves significant risks, including:

* **price volatility** and the risk of total loss;
* **smart contract** vulnerabilities, exploits, and economic attacks;
* **network** risks (congestion, downtime, forks, reorgs, validator issues);
* **wallet/security** risks (phishing, malware, key loss, compromised devices);
* **token** risks (depegs, freezes, issuer/admin controls, liquidity issues, wrapped-token risks);
* **oracle/data** risks (incorrect or manipulated price feeds, stale data);
* **regulatory** changes that may affect your ability to use crypto-assets or the Platform.

**13.2** You are solely responsible for assessing these risks and deciding whether to use the Platform. General Magic does not provide investment advice or risk assessments.

---

## 14. Tax, Reporting and Accounting

**14.1** You are solely responsible for determining and complying with any tax, reporting, accounting, and record-keeping obligations applicable to you, including obligations arising from:

* contributing Supported Tokens,
* receiving Supported Tokens,
* receiving or transferring rewards (including NFTs),
* gains, losses, income recognition, VAT/sales tax, or other tax consequences.

**14.2** General Magic does not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice and does not guarantee that the Platform will generate tax reports or statements suitable for your jurisdiction.

**14.3** On-chain data is generally public and may be used by you (or third parties) for record-keeping and analysis. Any summaries or exports the Platform provides (if any) are for convenience only and may be incomplete.

---

## 15. Intellectual Property

**15.1** **Platform IP.** The Platform (including its software, user interface, branding, and documentation) is owned by General Magic or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.

**15.2** **Limited licence to use.** Subject to these Terms, General Magic grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to access and use the Platform for its intended purpose.

**15.3** **User and campaign content.** Campaign content (including text, images, media, and updates) is provided by Raisers or users. Users retain ownership of their content, but by uploading, publishing, or storing content through the Platform you grant General Magic a licence to host, reproduce, display, and distribute that content as necessary to operate and promote the Platform and to provide transparency and historical access (subject to your privacy choices and applicable law).

**15.4** **Restrictions.** You must not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of the Platform except to the extent permitted by mandatory law. You must not use CrowdWalrus branding without prior written consent.

---

## 16. Data Protection and Privacy

**16.1** Our processing of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy (to the extent applicable). Where the Platform links to a Privacy Policy, that policy forms part of the overall information provided to users.

**16.2** **On-chain data is public.** You acknowledge that transactions on the Sui Network are generally public and may be visible to anyone, including wallet addresses, token amounts, timestamps, and Smart Contract interactions.

**16.3** **Decentralized storage.** The Platform may use decentralized or third-party storage systems (including Walrus Protocol) to store campaign materials or metadata. Such storage may be immutable, replicated, or difficult/impossible to remove once published.

**16.4** **Data minimization by design.** The Platform is intended to operate with minimal personal data. However, any information you publish in campaigns, updates, or profile fields may become public, copied, indexed, and retained by third parties.

**16.5** **Security.** We implement reasonable measures to protect the Platform, but no system is perfectly secure. You are responsible for securing your devices, wallets, accounts, and credentials.

---

## 17. Prohibited Use

**17.1** You must not use the Platform for:

* (a) any activity that is illegal under applicable law, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, tax evasion, child exploitation, sale of illegal goods or services, or any other criminal conduct;
* (b) infringing third-party intellectual property or privacy rights;
* (c) interfering with, attacking or reverse engineering the Platform, Smart Contracts, or the Sui Network, except to the extent permitted by law and responsible disclosure policies.

**17.2** We may take any action we deem appropriate (including suspension of your access, reporting to competent authorities, and cooperation with law enforcement) if we suspect prohibited use. Such actions are at our discretion and do not create any monitoring duty towards you or third parties.

---

## 18. Suspension and Termination

**18.1** **Suspension/termination rights.** We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Platform (in whole or in part) at any time, including if we:

* reasonably suspect prohibited use, fraud, or unlawful activity;
* believe you have violated these Terms;
* are required to do so by law, regulation, sanctions, or an authority request;
* need to protect the security, integrity, or availability of the Platform.

**18.2** **Effect on on-chain transactions.** Suspension or termination of your access to the Platform does not reverse, cancel, or affect blockchain transactions already confirmed on-chain.

**18.3** **No obligation to maintain access.** We do not guarantee continuous availability of the Platform or any specific feature. We may modify, discontinue, or deprecate functionality.

**18.4** **Your termination.** You may stop using the Platform at any time. Your obligations under these Terms (including Sections on liability, indemnity, and applicable law) survive as appropriate.

---

Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under mandatory Swiss law, including but not limited to liability for:

---

## 20. Indemnity

**20.1** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless General Magic, its directors, employees, contractors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with:

* (a) your use of the Platform;

* (d) any dispute between you and any other user (including any Raiser or Backer), or any third party, relating to campaigns, funds, rewards, content or activities.

**20.2** This indemnity does not apply to the extent a claim arises from General Magic’s wilful misconduct or gross negligence where such exclusion would be invalid under applicable law.

---
