In this Privacy Policy, **“CrowdWalrus”**, **“we”**, **“us”**, or **“our”** refers to General Magic AG as the controller of your personal data for the processing described here.

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with the **Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP / nFADP)** and, where applicable, the **EU/EEA General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and similar laws.
