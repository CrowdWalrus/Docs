# Disclaimer

**Last updated:** 2026-01-06

The CrowdWalrus platform (**“CrowdWalrus”**, the **“Platform”**) is operated by  
**General Magic AG** (**“General Magic”**, **“we”**, **“us”**, **“our”**).

This Disclaimer forms part of, and should be read together with, our **Terms & Conditions**.

By accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

---

## 1. No advice or recommendation

Nothing on the Platform constitutes or should be understood as:

- financial, investment, legal, tax, or other professional advice;
- a recommendation, invitation, or solicitation to donate, contribute, lend,
  invest, purchase, sell, or otherwise financially assist any campaign,
  project, person, or organisation.

Any decision to participate in, fund, or otherwise support a campaign is
**your own decision**, made **at your own risk**.

You should conduct your own independent research and, where appropriate,
seek professional advice before making any contribution.

---

## 2. No financial intermediary, no custody

The Platform is a technical interface that allows users to interact with
on-chain smart contracts on the **Sui blockchain**.

Contributions are designed to be **peer-to-peer (P2P)** transfers made
directly between the contributor’s wallet and the campaign owner’s
designated wallet or smart contract address.

General Magic does **not**:

- act as your bank, broker, custodian, payment service provider, trustee,
  agent, or financial intermediary; or
- hold, pool, or safeguard user funds on its own balance sheet.

We are not involved in, and do not execute or clear, any financial
transactions between payer and payee. All on-chain transfers take place
directly between users via the underlying blockchain and smart contracts.

---

## 3. No endorsement or advertising of campaigns

Campaign pages, descriptions, goals, and media are created and maintained
by the respective campaign owners (**“Raisers”**), not by General Magic.

The appearance of any campaign, cause, person, organisation, token, or
address on the Platform:

- does **not** mean we endorse, recommend, or approve it; and
- does **not** mean we have verified its legality, accuracy, feasibility,
  or trustworthiness.

Any examples, featured campaigns, or lists shown on the Platform are for
interface and navigation purposes only and do **not** constitute
advertising, solicitation, or promotion.

---

## 4. No responsibility for user or campaign conduct

Campaign owners (recipients) and contributors (payers/donors) are
independent users of the Platform. They act on their own behalf and at
their own risk.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, General Magic:

- is **not responsible** and assumes **no liability** for any actions or
  omissions of campaign owners, contributors, or other users, including
  (without limitation):
  - illegal activities;
  - fraud, scams, or misrepresentations;
  - misuse or diversion of funds;
  - failure to deliver promised rewards, updates, or outcomes; and
- has no duty to monitor, investigate, or vet campaigns or users on your
  behalf.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Platform
(including any contribution you make or receive) complies with all laws
applicable to you, including those relating to sanctions, anti-money
laundering, counter-terrorism financing, tax, and financial services.

---

## 5. On-chain nature of transactions and content

The Platform interacts with smart contracts and data stored on public,
decentralised networks, including the **Sui blockchain** and **Walrus
storage**.

Transactions and many forms of content are **permanently recorded
on-chain** or in decentralised storage and cannot be fully altered,
reversed, or removed by General Magic.

Because these systems are permissionless and globally accessible,
campaigns and transfers can, in principle, be created or used by anyone
with a compatible wallet. General Magic does not control who can deploy
or interact with the underlying smart contracts.

---

## 6. Your responsibility and risk

You should not contribute more than you can afford to lose. Digital
assets are highly volatile, and contributions may be lost in whole or in
part.

Before you send any funds, you should:

- verify the campaign, recipient address, and smart contract you are
  interacting with;
- understand the risks, including the possibility of fraud or illegality
  by third parties; and
- confirm that your participation is lawful under your local laws and any
  other applicable jurisdictions.

By using the Platform, you accept that you are solely responsible for:

- your decisions to create, fund, or otherwise interact with campaigns;
- your compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and
- any consequences arising from your use of the Platform.

---

Nothing in this Disclaimer limits or excludes any liability that cannot be
limited or excluded under mandatory law.

In the event of any conflict between this Disclaimer and the Terms &
Conditions, the **Terms & Conditions prevail**.
