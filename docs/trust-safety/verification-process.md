# Verification Process

This page describes the typical review flow.

## Step 1 — Campaign is created
Every campaign exists on-chain whether verified or not.

## Step 2 — Request / application
Depending on the current workflow:
- Either the campaign owner applies via a form, or
- the campaign is queued for review automatically.

(See next page for the current application link.)

## Step 3 — Reviewer checks
Reviewers typically look for:
- identity clarity (who is behind this?)
- proof links (repo, website, past work)
- budget + milestones
- compliance with the content policy

## Step 4 — Outcome
- **Approved** → verified badge granted, eligible for listing
- **Needs changes** → reviewer requests edits
- **Rejected** → no badge; campaign can still exist and raise funds if it doesn’t violate policy
