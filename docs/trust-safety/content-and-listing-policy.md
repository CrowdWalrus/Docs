# Content & Listing Policy

This policy defines:
- what’s allowed to exist on CrowdWalrus
- what’s eligible to be listed

## Baseline rule: open, but not lawless
CrowdWalrus is permissionless for creation.
But content that is illegal, fraudulent, or harmful is not welcome.

## Not allowed
- fraud / scams / impersonation
- illegal fundraising
- doxxing, harassment, hate content
- content that violates applicable laws

## Listing policy
Listing is curated.
A campaign may exist but not be listed if:
- it lacks proof
- it’s too low-effort / spam
- it violates platform guidelines

## Enforcement actions
- remove verified badge
- de-list from discovery
- deactivate campaign (where possible)
