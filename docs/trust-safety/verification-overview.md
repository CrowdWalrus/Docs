- anyone can donate

Verification exists to help users **navigate trust**.

## What verification is
A review process that can grant a campaign a **verified badge**, making it eligible for listing.

## What verification is not

- Not a guarantee
- Not a promise of future results

## Who verifies
In early phases, a small set of platform verifiers/admins.
Over time, this can evolve toward a community-led model.
