# Reporting Abuse / Scams

If you see something sketchy, report it. Early reports help protect donors, campaign owners, and the broader ecosystem.

:::warning
**GitHub issues are public.**  
Do **not** include private keys, seed phrases, passwords, or sensitive personal documents.

If your report includes sensitive info you shouldn’t post publicly, use email instead:  
<a href="mailto:crowdwalrus@generalmagic.io">crowdwalrus@generalmagic.io</a>
:::

## Fastest way to report (recommended)
Use the pre-filled GitHub report form:

<a href="https://github.com/CrowdWalrus/crowdwalrus-dapp/issues/new?template=report-abuse---scam-campaigns.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report abuse / scam campaign (GitHub issue)</a>

### How this report link works
1. Open the link (sign in to GitHub if needed).
2. A new issue page opens with the **Report Abuse / Scam Campaigns** template.
3. Fill the checklist + details (campaign link, category, evidence).
4. Submit the issue. Our team will triage it.

:::tip
Before submitting, it helps to quickly check if someone already reported it:
<a href="https://github.com/CrowdWalrus/crowdwalrus-dapp/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Browse existing issues</a>
:::

## What to include (minimum)
- **Campaign link**
- **Why you believe it’s abusive or unsafe**
- **Evidence** (screenshots, links, archived pages)
- **On-chain references** (tx digests for donations/updates), if available

## What happens after you report
We’ll typically:
- Review the campaign and the evidence provided
- Ask follow-up questions if needed (in the issue thread or via email)
- Take appropriate actions depending on severity (for example: de-listing from discovery, removing verification, adding warnings, or escalating to other channels)

:::info
CrowdWalrus is **non-custodial**. We don’t hold user funds, and we can’t reverse on-chain transfers. Reporting helps reduce harm by improving visibility, warnings, and review actions.
