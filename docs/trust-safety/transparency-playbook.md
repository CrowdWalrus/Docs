# Transparency Playbook

Want to run a campaign people actually trust?
Here’s what “good” looks like.

## The cadence
- Post an update at least every 1–2 weeks during funding.
- Post an update after major spends or milestones.

## Receipts
- link commits / PRs
- publish deliverables
- share invoices (redacted)
- share on-chain tx digests for major expenses

## Budget clarity
Break your budget into real categories:
- engineering
- design
- infra
- legal
- community

## Milestones
Tie funding to milestones:
- “If we raise $X, we ship Y.”
