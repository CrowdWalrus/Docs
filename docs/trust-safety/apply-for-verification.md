# Apply for Verification

Verification is an optional review that helps donors quickly understand **who is behind a campaign** and whether it meets CrowdWalrus listing standards.

Verified campaigns:
- receive a **Verified** badge
- become eligible for **listing / discovery surfaces** (curated)

:::info
CrowdWalrus is **non-custodial**. Verification does **not** change how funds move — donations still go directly from supporter wallets to your recipient wallet.
:::

:::warning
Verification is not an endorsement, a guarantee, or a promise of outcomes. It’s a trust signal based on the information you provide and what reviewers can verify at the time of review.
:::

## Apply via Typeform

<a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/HaM6QLE7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open the listing / verification application form</a>

If you’re in the app, you can also start the process from your campaign page (look for the **Unverified** badge) and follow the verification prompt.

## Before you apply

Make sure your campaign page is “review-ready”:
- Your **story** explains what you’re building/doing, for who, and why.
- Your **goal, timeline, budget, and milestones** are clear and specific.
- Your **recipient wallet address** is final (the same address donors will send funds to).
- Your **links** are real (website, repo, socials, docs), and ideally show prior work or activity.
- You’re ready to answer follow-up questions via email/Telegram/Discord.

:::tip
If you represent an organization, publish a short statement from an **official channel** (website, GitHub org, or primary social account) that links to your CrowdWalrus campaign page. Include that statement link in the form — it’s one of the fastest ways to prove ownership.

## What the application asks (and why)

The exact questions may evolve, but you can generally expect these sections:

### 1) Campaign details

**What you’ll be asked**
- Your campaign URL (and campaign name)
- A short summary of the campaign and what you’re fundraising for
- Category/tags and relevant links

**Why**
- Reviewers need a single canonical reference to evaluate your campaign content, claims, and on-chain setup.

### 2) Who is behind the campaign

**What you’ll be asked**
- Individual vs organization/collective
- Name and role of the applicant (who is submitting)
- Team/organization name (if applicable) and where you operate from

**Why**
- Listing is curated; donors need clarity on accountability — who can be contacted and who is responsible for updates.

### 3) Proof of legitimacy

**What you’ll be asked**
- Official website, GitHub, social accounts, or public profiles
- Evidence of prior work, history, or existing community presence
- Optional supporting documents (when relevant)

**Why**
- CrowdWalrus is open by default, but listed campaigns need enough evidence to reduce fraud and impersonation risk.

### 4) Proof you control (or represent) the campaign

**What you’ll be asked**
- A link to a public statement from your official channel that includes your campaign link
  - examples: a post on your website, a GitHub README, a tweet from your org account, a pinned announcement, etc.

**Why**
- This connects the on-chain campaign to a real-world identity and helps prevent “copycat” campaigns.

### 5) Budget and milestones

**What you’ll be asked**
- A budget breakdown (what funds will be used for)
- Concrete milestones + dates (what you’ll deliver, and when)
- What happens if you raise less/more than your target

**Why**
- Donors evaluate credibility through plans + receipts. Clear milestones make progress trackable and reduce misunderstandings.

:::info
For examples of “good” transparency, see the [Transparency Playbook](./transparency-playbook.md).
:::

### 6) Wallets and fund flow

**What you’ll be asked**
- The recipient Sui address that receives donations
- Any additional treasury/multisig addresses you use to manage funds (if any)
- Notes on custody (who controls the keys, and how you secure them)

**Why**
- CrowdWalrus does not hold funds. Reviewers check that the recipient address aligns with the identity claims and that the flow is easy for donors to verify on-chain.

:::warning
Never submit private keys, seed phrases, or recovery phrases. CrowdWalrus will never ask for them.
:::

### 7) Contact details

**What you’ll be asked**
- An email address and/or preferred contact handle
- Optional: a public support channel

**Why**
- Reviewers may request clarification, and listed campaigns are expected to be reachable if issues arise.

### 8) Policy acknowledgements

**What you’ll be asked**
- Confirmation that your campaign complies with platform rules and applicable laws
- Agreement to the listing/verification terms for reviewers (and potential de-listing if information is misleading)

**Why**
- Verification is based on trust and verifiability. Clear expectations reduce disputes and help protect donors.

You can read the rules upfront here: [Content & Listing Policy](./content-and-listing-policy.md)

## After you submit

- Reviewers will verify the information you provided and may ask for changes or clarification.
- If approved, your campaign will receive a **Verified** badge and become eligible for listing.
- If changes are needed, you can update your campaign page and re-apply or respond with additional evidence.

:::tip
Even after verification, ongoing trust comes from updates. Post progress regularly and link evidence (deliverables, repos, invoices with sensitive info redacted, on-chain tx digests).
