# How CrowdWalrus Works

CrowdWalrus is crowdfunding with **wallet-to-wallet** contributions and **transparency by default** — no custodial balances, no hidden money flow.

:::tip TL;DR
1) **Create** a campaign (goal + funding window + recipient wallet)  
2) **Publish & share** your campaign page anywhere  
3) Supporters **contribute from their wallets** (peer-to-peer)  
4) When the funding window ends, the campaign stays **Active** for **milestones + updates**  
5) Apply for **verification** to get listed — and **end/deactivate** anytime from the app

## The crowdfunding lifecycle (simple)

### 1) Create a campaign 🧱
As a campaign owner, you’ll set:
- **Title + story** (what you’re building + why it matters)
- **Goal** (your target)
- **Funding window** (start date → end date)
- **Recipient wallet** (where contributions go)
- **Categories + socials** (to help supporters validate you)

> You’ll need a **wallet** to create and manage a campaign.

---

### 2) Publish & share 📣
Crowdfunding is distribution.
Once your campaign is live, you can share:
- a direct link (X / Telegram / Discord / Farcaster / WhatsApp / email)
- your updates as new “reasons to re-share”

:::note Momentum rule
Most campaigns are won by repeated sharing + consistent updates — not one big launch post.

### 3) Supporters contribute (wallet-to-wallet) 🤝
Supporters:
- choose a token + amount
- **confirm in their wallet**
- funds go **directly to the campaign recipient wallet** (peer-to-peer)

:::caution Important
Wallet transactions are typically **irreversible**. Supporters should review the campaign page, proof, and updates before contributing.

### 4) Funding window ends — campaign stays Active ✅
When the funding window ends:
- the campaign **doesn’t disappear**
- it becomes a **milestone + accountability hub**
- the owner should keep posting updates like:
  - what shipped
  - what’s next
  - receipts (links, demos, commits, deliverables)

This is how long-term trust is earned.

---

### 5) Manage your campaign (edit, pause, end) 🧭
CrowdWalrus supports editing **some** campaign fields to keep your page accurate and up to date.

Typical actions:
- **Edit** campaign content (story/media, socials, categories, etc.)
- **Post updates** and milestone progress
- **Deactivate / end** the campaign from the app (stops new contributions)

> Some core fields may be intentionally immutable to prevent bait-and-switch.

## Getting listed: verification & discovery 🔎
CrowdWalrus is **open by default**:
- anyone can create a campaign
- any campaign can be shared by link

**Verification** is about **visibility + trust at scale**:
- **Unverified**: functional, shareable, usually not surfaced in discovery
- **Verified**: reviewed, eligible for listing surfaces (Explore / homepage)

**How to get listed**
1) Create your campaign  
2) Apply for verification  
3) If approved, your campaign can appear in discovery surfaces  

**See:** [Verification & Listing](../campaign-owners/verification-and-listing.md)  
**Apply:** [Apply for Verification](../trust-safety/apply-for-verification.md)

## Campaign statuses (what supporters will see)

- **Open Soon** — page is live, funding hasn’t started  
- **Funding** — contributions are enabled during the funding window  
- **Active** — funding window ended, campaign stays up for updates + history  
- **Ended** — owner deactivated/ended the campaign (no new contributions)

**Note:** “Verified vs Unverified” is separate from status — it affects **discovery**, not whether the campaign can exist.
