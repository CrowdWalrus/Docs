# Verification & Listing

CrowdWalrus is open by default:

✅ Anyone can create and publish a campaign.

Verification exists for one reason: **trust at scale** — especially when campaigns are shown in discovery.

## What the Verified badge means

A Verified badge signals that the campaign passed basic review checks, such as:

- it does not violate platform content rules
- the identity/story has enough proof to be trusted by new supporters
- the campaign is eligible for broader visibility (listing)

## Benefits of verification

- Eligible for **homepage / explore listing**
- Higher trust for supporters who don’t know you yet

## What verification does **not** do

- It does **not** guarantee campaign success.
- It does **not** mean CrowdWalrus endorses outcomes.
- It does **not** change how campaign statuses work (Open Soon / Funding / Active / Ended).

:::info
Verification affects **visibility and trust signals** — not functionality.  
Unverified campaigns can still raise funds normally.

## How to apply

You can apply in two ways:

1) **From your campaign page**  
Click the **Unverified** badge to start the verification request flow.

2) **Direct form link**  
- [Open verification request form](https://form.typeform.com/to/HaM6QLE7)

:::tip
Apply as early as possible (even during **Open Soon**) if you want the best chance to be listed when funding opens.
