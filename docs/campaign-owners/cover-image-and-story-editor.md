# Cover image + rich story editor

Your cover and story are your campaign’s “front door” — most supporters will decide in **~30 seconds** whether to keep reading.

This maps to **Step 3** (cover image) and **Step 8** (story) in [Launch a Campaign](./launch-a-campaign.md).

## Cover image

Your cover image is your campaign’s visual ID across CrowdWalrus:

- Campaign cards and listings
- The campaign page header
- Social previews (when people share your link)

Recommended guidelines:

- Use **JPG** or **PNG**
- Keep it under **~5MB**
- Assume many people will view it on **mobile**
- Prefer a clear subject and minimal text (tiny text won’t be readable)

:::tip
If your cover image includes text, keep it large and high-contrast — and place it away from edges so it won’t get cropped on different screens.
:::

### Content and permanence (Walrus)

Cover images are stored on **Walrus** (decentralized storage). That means:

- The stored file is **public content**
- CrowdWalrus can’t secretly modify it
- A specific uploaded version is **immutable**

:::warning
**Treat uploads as public and permanent**  
Don’t upload private keys, passports, phone numbers, private invoices, or anything you wouldn’t publish publicly.
If you update your cover later, it typically means uploading a **new version** — older versions may still exist by their content IDs.

## Rich story editor

The story editor supports:

- Rich formatting (headings, lists, links)
- Inline images
- A structured narrative that supporters can verify

**Where it’s stored: Walrus**
- The editor content is stored as structured data (e.g., JSON)
- Inline images are stored as blobs

This keeps your campaign readable and verifiable without relying on a single centralized server.

## A simple structure that converts (and builds trust)

Use this outline (copy/paste and fill it in):

### Who?
Who you are (person, team, org) — and why you’re trusted to execute.

### What?
What you’re raising for — the concrete deliverable(s).

### Why?
Why it matters, and why now.

### Where?
Where the work happens (online / local / global) and who it helps.

### How?
How funds will be used + how you’ll report progress (updates, milestones, proof).

### When?
When supporters should expect key milestones and updates.

:::tip
Write the first **2–3 lines** as a standalone summary.  
If someone only reads that, they should still understand your campaign.

## Make impact easy to understand

Supporters love clarity. Add:

- **2–4 example contribution amounts** and what they unlock
- A simple budget breakdown (tools, people, shipping, audits, research hours, etc.)
- Links to proof (repo, docs, demos, prior work)

## Build “proof loops” into your story

If you want serious supporters, set expectations up front:

- How often you’ll post updates
- What you’ll share as proof (photos, links, receipts, shipped deliverables)
- What “done” looks like for your first milestone
