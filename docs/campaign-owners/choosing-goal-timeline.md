# Choosing a goal & timeline

This step defines **how your campaign is measured** (goal) and **when supporters can contribute** (funding window).

It maps to **Step 6** in [Launch a Campaign](./launch-a-campaign.md).

## Goal (USD)

CrowdWalrus asks for a **USD goal** so campaigns are easy to compare and understand at a glance.

What the goal affects:

- Your **progress bar** and **% funded**
- How your campaign appears in cards and listings
- Supporters’ “does this look achievable?” first impression

What the goal does **not** do:

- It **does not stop contributions** when reached  
  Support can continue until your **funding window ends**.

:::info
**How USD value is calculated**  
Supporters contribute in supported tokens. Your progress toward the USD goal is calculated using the token’s **price at the time of each contribution**.

### How to pick a good goal

A strong goal is the **minimum amount you truly need** to deliver something real.

Best practice:

- Tie the goal to a **specific deliverable** (prototype, event, audit, shipment batch, research milestone)
- Keep it **realistic** for your chosen timeline and audience size
- If you need more later, it’s often cleaner to launch a **second campaign** than inflate the first one “just in case”

### Quick checklist before you submit

- [ ] “If we raise this amount, we can ship ___.”
- [ ] Your budget explanation matches the goal (even roughly)
- [ ] The goal feels achievable within your funding window

## Timeline (your funding window)

Your timeline is the **start and end date** for fundraising — the period when supporters can contribute.

Campaign status behavior:

1. **Open Soon** — Campaign can be visible before funding starts (great for sharing early).
2. **Funding** — Contributions are enabled during your selected dates.
3. **Active** — Once the end date passes, contributions close automatically and your campaign stays visible for updates, proof, and milestones.

### Picking a timeline that works

Most campaigns perform best with a window that creates urgency **without** becoming stressful to manage.

Common patterns:

- **2–6 weeks**: a practical sweet spot for most creators and teams
- **Shorter windows**: higher urgency, but you need strong distribution on day 1
- **Longer windows**: requires consistent updates and a clear promotion plan

Practical guidance:

- Plan for a strong **first 48–72 hours** (announce + share + early supporters)
- Schedule at least **1–2 updates** during the funding window
- Align dates with your real life constraints (shipping, launch dates, milestones)
