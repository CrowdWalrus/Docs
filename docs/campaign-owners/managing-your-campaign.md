# Managing Your Campaign

Once your campaign is live, your job shifts from “launch” to **operate with clarity** — keep supporters informed, keep the page accurate, and keep trust high.

:::info
**TL;DR**
- You can manage a campaign in **two ways**:  
  1) From the **campaign page** (Private Mode) when the owner wallet is connected  
  2) From **My Campaigns** in the header (profile route)  
- Campaign management includes: **Edit**, **Deactivate (End)**, **Post updates**, and **Delete** (irreversible).
- Some fields are intentionally **not editable** to prevent bait-and-switch and protect supporters.

## Why campaign management matters

CrowdWalrus is **non-custodial**: funds go directly from supporters to the recipient wallet.  
That means your campaign page becomes the source of truth for:

- What you promised
- What you shipped
- What changed
- What’s next

A well-managed campaign stays credible even after funding ends.

## Two ways to access campaign management

### Option 1 — Manage from the campaign page (Private Mode)

If you open your campaign **while your owner wallet is connected**, CrowdWalrus can recognize you as the campaign owner and show **Private Mode** controls.

**Steps**
1. Connect your wallet.
2. Open your campaign page.
3. If the connected address is the campaign owner, you’ll see **Private Mode** and additional management controls.

:::tip
Private Mode exists because CrowdWalrus is wallet-native.  
Only the campaign owner wallet can access sensitive actions and confirm changes.

### Option 2 — Manage from your profile (Header → My Campaigns)

You can also manage campaigns from your profile route:

**Steps**
1. Connect your wallet.
2. From the header, open **My Campaigns**.
3. Under your connected address, you’ll see a **My Campaigns** link.
4. You can view all campaigns created by your address and open any of them to manage.

This route is best when you have multiple campaigns and want a single dashboard-style entry point.

## What “Managing a campaign” includes

When you’re the campaign owner, management typically includes:

### 1) Edit campaign info
Update the parts of your campaign that are meant to evolve (like your story, visuals, and links).

### 2) Deactivate (End) the campaign
Stop contributions by ending/deactivating the campaign.

- Useful when the campaign is completed early
- Useful when you need to pause fundraising permanently

### 3) Post updates (Milestones & communication)
Updates are how you stay accountable and keep supporters in the loop.

Good updates can include:
- Delivered milestones
- Progress reports
- Challenges and changes in plan
- Anything that helps supporters understand what’s happening

### 4) Delete the campaign (irreversible)
Deleting removes the campaign from the product view and **cannot be undone**.

:::danger
**Deleting a campaign is permanent.**  
After deletion, the campaign and its information are **not recoverable** and will no longer be visible.
If you just want to stop fundraising, prefer **Deactivate/End**.

## What you can edit (and what you can’t)

CrowdWalrus supports editing **some** fields — and intentionally locks others.

### Typically editable
- Campaign name
- Short description
- Categories
- Social links
- Story + cover (Walrus-backed)
- Storage duration (by re-uploading Walrus content)

:::warning
Walrus-backed content may require:
- a small amount of **WAL** for storage
- a small amount of **SUI** for gas

If you re-upload, double-check your storage duration so the campaign content stays available while the campaign is active.
:::

### Typically not editable (by design)
- Funding goal
- Recipient address
- Subname / campaign identifier
- Start/end dates

:::tip
**Why are these locked?**  
To prevent bait-and-switch behavior and keep donations honest.  
Supporters should not discover that the recipient wallet, goal, or timeline changed after they contributed.
:::

## Posting updates that supporters actually care about

A strong update is simple and verifiable without being over-sharing.

A practical structure:
- **What changed?** (milestone delivered, status update, decision made)
- **What’s the outcome?** (demo link, screenshots, shipped feature, community impact)
- **What’s next?** (clear next step + timeframe)

:::info
Transparency doesn’t mean leaking private details.  
Never share private keys, personal documents, sensitive invoices, or anything you wouldn’t want public forever.
