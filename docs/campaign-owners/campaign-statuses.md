# Campaign Statuses

CrowdWalrus campaigns follow a simple lifecycle based on the **fundraising window** (start/end time) and whether the campaign has been **deactivated** by its owner.



## Status flow

Open Soon → Funding → Active → Ended

- **Open Soon**: published, but fundraising hasn’t opened yet  
- **Funding**: fundraising window is open, contributions are accepted  
- **Active**: fundraising window is closed, campaign continues for accountability + updates  
- **Ended**: owner deactivates the campaign after wrap-up

---

## Open Soon

The campaign is **published**, but the **fundraising window start time** is still in the future.

- Supporters can **view and read** the campaign page.
- **Donations are not open yet.**
- The campaign owner can **share the link**, build momentum, and promote the upcoming start.

:::tip
Use **Open Soon** to warm up your supporters: share the page early, explain the timeline, and get people ready for launch day.
:::

## Funding

The current time is **within the fundraising window** (between start and end).

- **Donations are enabled.**
- Every contribution is **counted and traceable** on the campaign page.
- Supporters can participate and help drive the campaign toward its goal.

## Active

The fundraising **end time has passed** — **funding is closed**, whether the goal was reached or not.

- **Donations are disabled.**
- The campaign page stays live for:
  - posting updates and progress reports
  - sharing milestones and outcomes
  - clarifying rewards/repayment/thank-you plans (if any)
  - showing impact (public goods, social outcomes, deliverables)
  - staying accountable to supporters

:::warning
When the fundraising end date is reached, **funding closes automatically** — even if the campaign hasn’t hit its goal.
:::

## Ended

The campaign owner **deactivates** the campaign after completing their wrap-up (updates, milestones, rewards/commitments).

- **Donations are disabled.**
- The campaign is shown as **Ended** for clear status signaling and transparency.

## Verified vs Unverified (visibility)

Verification is **separate** from campaign status.

A campaign can be verified or unverified in **any** of the statuses above.

- **Unverified**: fully functional and can raise funds, but usually **not shown** in Explore/Discovery.
- **Verified**: reviewed by platform verifiers, receives a **Verified badge**, and becomes **eligible for listing** in Explore/Home.

:::info
Verification affects **visibility**, not functionality.  
Unverified campaigns still work end-to-end — they’re just not promoted in discovery by default.
