# Non-profit vs Commercial Campaigns

CrowdWalrus supports different payout policies via **policy presets**.

## Self-declaration model
When you create a campaign, you select a policy preset.

Typical presets:
- **Nonprofit / Public goods** (often 0 platform fee)
- **Commercial** (platform fee applies)

## Fees & disclosures
If a platform fee applies, it is:
- shown in the donation UI before you sign
- enforced on-chain in the donation transaction

If you select a nonprofit preset, be ready to provide proof during verification.
