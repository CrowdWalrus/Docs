# Categories & socials

Categories help discovery. Social links help trust.

It maps to **Step 5** in [Launch a Campaign](./launch-a-campaign.md).

## Categories

Choose categories that make it easy for supporters to understand your campaign in one glance.

Why categories matter:

- They improve **search and filtering**
- They provide quick **context** (what kind of project is this?)
- They help your campaign show up to the right audience

Best practice:

- Pick **1–3 categories** that truly match your work
- Don’t “over-tag” just for visibility — clarity beats noise

Typical categories include:

- Art & Culture  
- Community  
- Education  
- Environment & Energy  
- Health & Wellness  
- NGO / Nonprofits  
- Technology  
- Others

:::tip
If your campaign is a public good, choose categories that match the *beneficiary* (who it helps), not only the *tooling* you use.

## Social links (up to 5)

Social links are your fastest trust signal. They let supporters verify you’re real and assess your track record.

Recommended order:

1. **Primary proof link** (website / repo / docs / portfolio)
2. **Identity link** (team page, profile, or public org page)
3. **Community hubs** (X, Discord, Telegram, etc.)
4. **Progress evidence** (demo, changelog, blog, Notion roadmap)

Best practice:

- Link what you can **prove**, not what you can promise
- Prefer stable destinations (your domain, GitHub repo, long-lived docs)
- Keep links clean and direct (avoid link shorteners if possible)

:::warning
Everything you add is public. Don’t link to private documents, unlisted drive folders, or anything you wouldn’t want indexed and shared.
