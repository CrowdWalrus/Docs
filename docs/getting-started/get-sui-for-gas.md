# Get $SUI for gas

Every on-chain action in CrowdWalrus requires **SUI gas**, including:
- creating a campaign
- contributing
- posting updates
- editing Walrus-backed content (when applicable)

:::info
**Mainnet:** you need **real SUI** (there is **no faucet**).  
**Testnet:** use a faucet to get **free test SUI**.

## Mainnet (real SUI)

### Option A — Buy SUI with fiat (on-ramp)
Most wallets or on-ramp providers let you buy SUI directly.

**Steps**
1. Choose **Buy SUI**
2. Make sure the destination is **Sui Mainnet**
3. Paste your **Sui address** (`0x...`)
4. Complete purchase (availability depends on your region / KYC rules)

### Option B — Buy on an exchange, then withdraw to your wallet
**Steps**
1. Buy **SUI**
2. Go to **Withdraw**
3. Select **Network: Sui** (or **Sui Mainnet**)
4. Paste your **Sui address**
5. Withdraw a small test amount first (recommended), then the rest

:::caution
When withdrawing, **do not pick Ethereum/EVM networks**. CrowdWalrus works on **Sui Mainnet** only.
:::

### Option C — Bridge from another chain (advanced)
If you already hold assets elsewhere, you can bridge into Sui and then swap to SUI if needed.

## Pro tip: keep a small SUI buffer

If you run out of SUI gas, you can’t sign anything—even if you still have other tokens.
