### üö´ What‚Äôs out of MVP scope in general

1. We won‚Äôt support sub-name resolution on our app; we will handle subname detection by path. So we are going to have https://crowdwalrus.io/campaigns/campaign-subname
2. We won‚Äôt have a multiplier verifier for the MVP. The number of projects is limited, and the admin can review them in MVP.
3. All the financial cap models are ‚Äútake it all‚Äù (TIA), so if a campaign could not meet its financial model at the end of the allowed period, the funds won‚Äôt get back to the payers.
4. We can‚Äôt write an indexer in this limited time, so the loading for some heavy-data views will be a bit slow due to the blockchain limitations.
5. Projects as hosts of campaigns may be too much for MVP.
